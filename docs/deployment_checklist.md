# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Create production directories:
  - `logs/` for application logs
  - `checkpoints/` for state checkpoints
  - `reports/` for performance reports

  - Structured logging enabled
  - Log rotation configured
  - Separate logs for app, performance, and errors

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- [x] Dynamic quality scaling implemented
  - Viewport quality levels configured
  - FPS-based adjustment system active
  - Smooth transitions between quality levels
- [x] Selective preview updates enabled
  - Update queue system implemented
  - Batch processing configured
  - Quality-based simplification active
- [x] Hardware-aware batch sizes configured
  - Tier-based defaults set
  - Dynamic adjustment system active
  - Performance history tracking enabled

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring:
  - Frame time tracking
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Operation time logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking:
  - Exception logging
  - Stack trace collection
  - Error categorization
- [ ] Enable metric collection:
  - Hardware profile metrics
  - Quality level changes
  - Batch size adjustments

### 4. Testing
- [x] Live performance test completed
  - All metrics within thresholds
  - No errors or warnings
  - Results documented
- [ ] Cross-hardware validation:
  - Test on low-end configuration
  - Test on mid-range configuration
  - Test on high-end configuration
- [ ] Edge case testing:
  - Memory pressure scenarios
  - High-load operations
  - Recovery from errors

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Preparation
- [ ] Final code review
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Clean up debug code
- [ ] Optimize imports
- [ ] Remove development flags

### 2. Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Include performance tuning tips

### 3. Deployment
- [ ] Create deployment package
- [ ] Verify dependencies
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure startup scripts
- [ ] Test deployment process

### 4. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor initial usage
- [ ] Verify logging
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Document any issues

## Rollback Plan

### 1. Triggers
- Performance degradation beyond thresholds
- Critical errors in production
- Data integrity issues

### 2. Steps
1. Stop new user sessions
2. Switch to previous version
3. Restore configuration
4. Verify system state
5. Resume operations

### 3. Validation
- Verify system functionality
- Check performance metrics
- Validate data integrity
- Test critical operations

## Maintenance Plan

### 1. Regular Tasks
- Monitor log files
- Review performance metrics
- Clean up old checkpoints
- Update hardware profiles

### 2. Periodic Reviews
- Performance optimization effectiveness
- Resource usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- User feedback and issues

### 3. Updates
- Schedule regular updates
- Plan feature deployments
- Coordinate with team
- Document changes
