- **Measurement Count**: 6 interaction tests

## Browser Compatibility

### Safari
- WebGL rendering maintains consistent performance across dataset sizes
- Export functionality works reliably with all dataset types
- Memory usage remains stable during WebGL operations

### Edge
- Touch events process with minimal latency
- Gesture recognition operates efficiently
- Export operations maintain consistent performance

## Performance Expectations

### Dataset Size Guidelines
- **Small Datasets** (<10,000 points):
  - Instant rendering (<0.001s)
  - Near-instant export (<0.1s)
  - Minimal memory impact

- **Medium Datasets** (10,000-100,000 points):
  - Fast rendering (<0.001s)
  - Quick export (<0.5s)
  - Moderate memory usage increase

- **Large Datasets** (100,000-1,000,000 points):
  - Consistent rendering (<0.001s)
  - Reasonable export times (<5s)
  - Expected memory usage up to ~200MB

### Resource Usage Guidelines
- **Memory**: 
  - Expected range: 50MB-200MB
  - Alert threshold: >250MB
  - Action required: >300MB

- **Render Times**:
  - Expected range: 0.0001s-0.001s
  - Alert threshold: >0.1s
  - Action required: >0.5s

- **Export Times**:
  - Small datasets: <0.1s
  - Medium datasets: <1s
  - Large datasets: <5s
  - Alert threshold: >10s

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Current Monitoring
