Subject: Frontend-Backend Integration Sync-Up - Documentation Review and Meeting Request

Hi Agent 1,

I hope this finds you well! I've been working on the backend implementation for our CAD/CAM program, and I'm excited to sync up with you to discuss frontend-backend integration. I've prepared some documentation that I'd like you to review before our meeting:

1. **Interface Specification** (`frontend_interface.md`):
   - Defines data structures for shape parameters and transformations
   - Outlines events and methods for communication
   - Includes mesh data format for viewport integration
   - Details implementation considerations and examples

2. **Integration Test Suite** (`test_scene_manager.py`):
   - Demonstrates backend functionality
   - Shows expected behavior for shape creation, transformation, and selection
   - Provides examples of error handling

3. **Meeting Agenda** (`sync_meeting_agenda.md`):
   - Structured 50-minute discussion
   - Covers interface review, implementation priorities, and timeline
   - Includes technical considerations and next steps

Could you please:
1. Review these documents at your earliest convenience
2. Share your availability for a 50-minute sync-up meeting this week
3. Note any initial questions or concerns you'd like to discuss

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on:
- The proposed mesh data format for viewport rendering
- The event-driven communication approach
- The implementation timeline and priorities

Please let me know if you need any clarification on the documentation or have alternative suggestions for the meeting structure.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best regards,
Agent 2

P.S. I've attached the documents to this email for your review.
